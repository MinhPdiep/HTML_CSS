    <h1>Box Model</h1>
    <p > You’ve been there countless times. You walk into a networking event or social function and the first extroverted
        person drops the suspect questions we’ve all heard ad nauseam:
        What do you do?
        Where are you from?
        Predictable and exhausting. As you run through the scripted answer in your head, you wonder, “Is this someone I
        really want to talk to?”
        The problem is, most of us are guilty of asking those dreaded, superficial questions that lead nowhere beyond
        the small talk. </p>
    <p> Truth is, we aren’t consciously aware of when we bore others; in our heads, we think our topics are brilliant
        and the person nodding in front of us with that glazed look is fascinated by something interesting to us only.
